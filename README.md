## AdminLTEOnRails

AdminLTEOnRails ports the famous [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE) control panel theme to the Rails framework. If you are a Rails developer and looking forward to use AdminLTE in your application, AdminLTEOnRails provides you with the same functionalities that you can get from AdminLTE with some couple ofsuper charged extras.

### What are those super charged extras?
#### MVC design:
All the main items that you see on the sidebar come with their own controller. This provides you to have a similar backend design that you have on the UI.
#### Granular access:
AdminLTEOnRails partitions all the the views and layouts by using partials. This feature provides a developer to focus on a section of a view without getting into the details of a full page view.
#### App Configuration:
AdminLTEOnRails provides a config class for its users to configure the application for their needs. After the configuration is done, the settings get applied to all the views in the application.
#### Gemification:
Most of the dependency files were moved to into the Gemfile. This way, Rails takes care of all the dependency configuration for its users.
